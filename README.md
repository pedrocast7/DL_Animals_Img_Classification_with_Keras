# ML_Multi-label_Img_Classification_with_Keras
A repository with a multi-label image classification problem to explore some models and basic concepts of Machine Learning. Just jump right into the notebook to check both the code and documentation.
#### Footnote: if you get any problem loading the dataset, download it directly from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/twitter-tweets-sentiment-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10)
Acknowledgments: Corrado Alessio.
#### Due to some issues with the RAM of the Kaggle session, I recommend running the notebook locally. If you can't do so, run until the 2.6 section, restart the kernel then run from this section to the end.
